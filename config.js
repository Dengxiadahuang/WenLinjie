            description: 'Therefore, in addressing these two issues, sharing a shared/green vehicle may become a complementary model for green production. Singapore has already launched a wide range of shared media, and here we focus on introducing car lite. Car lite means using less of private transport and using more high-capacity public transport like trains and buses. Bicycle-sharing, too, forms an integral part of using less of private transport. Going car-lite benefits communities and the city in many ways; it not only encourages the move towards a liveable and sustainable environment, but also gives streets back to people. From Car-Free Sundays to regular car-free zones, experience how streets become vibrant meaningful public spaces for everyone to enjoy.',

In the future, such car rentals may be changed to a more user-friendly model, using taxi stops as a reference to set up car rentals and deploy electric cars. Users can use online apps to find nearby rental points and assist with renting. When this model reaches a certain scale, with the upgrading of public transportation, we can achieve private car free nationwide.',
